# Developing optimal bicycle network growth strategies

This repository contains the code to replicate the algorithms and measures in the paper Natera, L.G., Battiston, F., IÃ±iguez, G., and Szell, M. *"Developing optimal bicycle network growth strategies"*, 2019.

+ The first notebook takes the multilayer networks for the fifteen different cities and calculates their corresponding overlap census.
+ Second notebook contains the algorithms L2C, L2S, CC, and R2C to grow bicycle networks. It also has the code to calculate bicycle-car directness $\Delta$
+ Finally, the third notebook has the code to make the plots with the measures of the algorithms.

The data we used for the analysis is available at Harvard Dataverse.
