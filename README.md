# Developing optimal bicycle network growth strategies

This repository contains the code to replicate the algorithms and measures in the paper Natera, L.G., Battiston, F., IÃ±iguez, G., and Szell, M. *"Developing optimal bicycle network growth strategies"*, 2019.

## Guide
1. ```01_Multiplex.ipynb``` --> Takes the multilayer networks for the fifteen different cities and calculates their corresponding overlap census.
1. ```02_BicycleAlgorithms.ipynb``` --> Deploy the algorithms L2C, L2S, CC, and R2C to grow bicycle networks and calculates the bicycle-car directness.
1. ```03_Plots.ipynb``` --> Makes the plots with the measures of the algorithms.

The data we used for the analysis is available at Harvard Dataverse.
